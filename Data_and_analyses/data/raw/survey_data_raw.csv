I ended up pressing buttons mostly randomly. I think the numbers scrolling across the screen represented fact-checking scores, where 100 would be ""true"" and 0 would be ""false"" and the numbers were either in blue (Democrat) or red (Republican). And I believe I was supposed to use the scrolling numbers to guess which candidate was more truthful. But the numbers kept scrolling and it felt SO random and when I was clicking I could not establish a clear pattern at all. Perhaps that was the point (although I highly doubt it) but I wanted to let you know because if this task was actually real with a salient manipulation, I completely missed it. Thanks! ",200892
